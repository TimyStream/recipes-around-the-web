# Mango Sorbet

## What do you need?

* Frozen mango pieces
* Milk
* Honey
* Ice cubes if needed

## How do we make it?

1. Add into a blender:
    * Frozen mango pieces
    * Splash of milk
    * Honey
2. Blend it until it reaches a smooth, shlushy-like consistency
3. If the consistency is too drippy, add a few ice cubes and blend again
4. Transfer it into another container / bowl and place it in the freezer for at least 30 minutes

## How to serve it?

You can serve the Mango Sorbet like ice cream in a bowl. Adding a little bit of chocolate syrup or fresh fruits with a little dash of whipped cream makes the Sorbet even better

## Hint
This dish can also be made with frozen strawberrys and bananas. For a chocolate sorbet use the same recipe but with frozen bananas and a teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa powder
